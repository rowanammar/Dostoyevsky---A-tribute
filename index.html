            <p class="biography">
              Fyodor Dostoyevsky was a Russian novelist, short story writer,
              essayist, and journalist. His literary works explore human
              psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual
              atmospheres of 19th-century Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="biography">
              Dostoyevsky's works are known for their deep exploration of human
              psychology, complex characters, and philosophical themes. His
              novels often delve into the darkest corners of the human mind,
              grappling with issues such as guilt, redemption, free will, and
              the existence of God. Despite his turbulent life, marked by
              financial hardship, epilepsy, and political persecution,
              Dostoyevsky's profound insights into the human condition have left
              an indelible mark on literature. His works continue to be studied,
              analyzed, and revered by scholars and readers worldwide.
